This application does scrape data from https://www.cermati.com/karir
It means to be an example of how to package your own Jython application
in a manner that requires no external dependancies other than a JVM
on the host computer.

To base your own project off this example you should understand how
this package is organized:

 * /src 
    Put all of your Jython source code here

 * /lib
    Put any .jar dependancies in this directory. Any .jar in this
    directory will automatically be loaded when the application starts
    so there is no need to mess with a CLASSPATH.

    This sample project has two dependancies:

      * Jython itself (jython.jar)
    
    Since this is a Jython project, the jython jar is required in this
    directory. For most applications, you will want a "full" or self
    contained Jython .jar which contains the entire Jython /Lib
    directory inside. This jar should be called jython-full.jar to
    differentiate it from the one that the regular Jython installer builds.

    See the Jython build instructions below for more details.

 * /java-src
    This is meant to be a Python project, but since this is Jython,
    there's no reason you can't include some Java code as well, so put
    that in this directory.

    One thing that is required in this directory is some sort of
    bootstrap mechanism to start your Jython code. You can do that
    however you want, but a sample Main.java is included. If you call
    yours something different, you need to update the Manifest.MF
    option One-Jar-Main-Class.

 * /onejar-src
    Part of the technology which powers this application is the OneJar
    platform (http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/). This takes care of
    loading "jars within jars" which is a problem for the regular Java 
    classloader. You shouldn't need to touch this code unless
    you want to upgrade to a later version for some reason.

    OneJar is accompanied by it's own free license called
    one-jar-license.txt. In order to comply with this license, the
    license is automatically built into any .jar that this package builds.


Building the JAR:

    You need Apache Ant installed. It should be sufficient to just 
    run 'ant' in the same directory as build.xml

        ant -buildfile build.xml
    
    Ant should create a new jar file called solution.jar
    which you can then run:

        java -jar solution.jar

    To see what's inside the .jar file
    you can run:

        jar tf solution.jar
